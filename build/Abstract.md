<h1> Abstract</h1>
<ul>

<li> The prediction of the share market value is of great importance to help in maximizing the profit of stock purchase while keeping the risk low. With latest advancement in technologies, the opportunity to gain a steady fortune from the share market is increased, which also helps experts to find out the most informative indicators to make a better prediction. 

<li> Machine learning has many applications, one of which is to forecast time series. One of the most interesting (or perhaps most profitable) time series to predict are, arguably, stock prices.Â 

<li> Using features like the latest announcements about an organization, their quarterly revenue results, etc., machine learning techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights, that we did not see before, and these can be used to make unerringly accurate predictions.

<li> The analysis of historical stock data sets and extracting certain trends would help to predict the future value of the stock. For prediction, a recurrent neural network will be fed with a preprocessed historical value of a stock value for getting trained on the time series. Once trained the neural network later would be used for making some predictions for next trading day(s). Based on these predictions a potential Buys and Sells for given stock can be generated for a potential swing trade.
